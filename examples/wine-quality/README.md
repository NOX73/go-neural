# Wine quality

Abstract: Two datasets are included, related to red and white vinho verde wine samples, from the north of Portugal. The goal is to model wine quality based on physicochemical tests (see [Cortez et al., 2009]).

## Example
This example demonstrate the application of a regressor:
* with 100 epochs, 70 percent training data, 0.9 learning with 0.001 decay
* Regression threshold of 0.2
* 100 hidden neurons

## Learning
The learning here is that the regressor decides between correct vs. wrong classified using a threshold. You can change this threshold to bring more tolerance to the system.
