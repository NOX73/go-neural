This repository provides examples to gopher-neural. You can find the code here: https://github.com/flezzfx/gopher-neural


## Sonar

Basic example that uses the engine of gopher-neural to train a small neural network with basic parameters. More information in sonar ReadMe file. Data from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Connectionist+Bench+%28Sonar%2C+Mines+vs.+Rocks%29

## Wine quality

In this example we train a regressor (we don't have classes but real value to determine). The quality of the wine is very important because wine is tasty (or should be). So here we have some criteria we can use to determine good from bad wine. Data from: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality

## More to come

stay tuned.
